* Meyvn client

This is the official Emacs client for the [[https://meyvn.org][Meyvn]] build tool.

It complements Cider and interfaces with a nREPL connection to add capabilities such as hot-loading, reload on save, teardown and rebuild of application state, and more.

** Installation

Pending MELPA approval and inclusion, this is how you can install the Meyvn client.

- Clone this repository.
- Insert in your ~init.el~:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(let ((meyvn-el (expand-file-name "~/path/to/meyvn.el")))
  (when (file-exists-p meyvn-el)
    (autoload 'meyvn-connect meyvn-el "Meyvn client" t)))
#+end_src

This will lazily load ~Meyvn~ which will invoke its full powers after the user summons ~meyvn-connect~ to connect to a Meyvn-enhanced nREPL.
